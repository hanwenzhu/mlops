# Ideas to improve automation

* Provide tests to automate all CK components and workflows across all available platforms
* Prepare MLPerf submissions in Octomizer
* Test ML models with real workflows (image classificaiton, object detection, NLP) in Octomizer similar to [CK demo](https://cknowledge.io/solution/demo-obj-detection-coco-tf-cpu-webcam-linux-azure/#test)
* Add more details about how set up RPi4, Nvidia, Coral Edge TPU and other boards from scratch
* Add CK client connected with Octomizer for private customers to benchmark models on their own platforms (use AMD as example)???
